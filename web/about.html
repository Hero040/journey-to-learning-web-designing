   <img src="image0_0.jpg" alt="human photo">
   <h2> HOW I STARTED</h2> <p>I started to learn web designing using plenty educational educational sites. I started learning how to design a website at the age of 1. Most of the sites I have used were not helping me except FREE CODE CAMP.
        Building a website allows you to express your creativity, bringing your ideas to life. I had many challeneges  while learning howto design. So far I have created 499999 websites. Learning how to create a website 
        can be disturbing.In conclusion, code optimization is a critical aspect of web development. By streamlining code, developers can improve performance, scalability, and readability. The example of combining shared 
        styles demonstrates the tangible benefits of optimization. By adopting best practices and regularly refining their code, developers can ensure efficient, maintainable, and high-performance web applications.</p><br>
